# ttd-frontend-test (Frontend)

ttd-frontend-test is basically a technical coding test project where I build the frontend of a small single page application to fetch data of movie titles from given API. I then do a Ascending Sorting for all the datas collected and show it to the main page.

## Snapshot of Web App :
